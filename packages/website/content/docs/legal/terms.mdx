3.8 **Feedback.** Customer may choose to or Fabric may invite Customer to submit comments or ideas about Fabric’s products and services, including the Offerings and Documentation (“Feedback”). By submitting any Feedback, Customer agrees that its disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place Fabric under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that Fabric is free to use the Feedback without any additional compensation to Customer or anyone else, or to disclose the Feedback on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone.

4.4 **Fee Increases.** Fabric may, in its sole discretion, increase or otherwise modify the Fees each renewal period during the Subscription Term by providing Customer notice of changes to the Fees at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current initial or renewal subscription term.

No assignment or delegation will relieve the assigning or delegating Party of any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

13.2 **Delays.** In the event that either party is prevented from performing or is unable to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement (other than any payment obligation) due to any Act of God, fire, casualty, flood, earthquake, war, strike, lockout, epidemic, destruction of production facilities, riot, insurrection, material unavailability, or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of the party invoking this Section 13.2 (each a “Force Majeure Event”), and if such party shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its effects, such party shall give prompt written notice to the other party, and the time for the performance shall be extended for the period of delay or inability to perform due to such occurrences.

13.3 **Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.** This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to its principles of conflicts of laws, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the Sale of Goods.

The parties hereby consent to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of these courts. For any dispute in connection with this Agreement, the parties agree to first attempt to mutually resolve the dispute informally via negotiation. If the dispute has not been resolved after thirty (30) days, the parties agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach, by binding arbitration in New York, NY, in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures of Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Service (“JAMS”).

13.11 **Entire Agreement; Waiver; Severability.** This Agreement represents the entire agreement between the parties, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, written or oral, with respect to the matters covered by this Agreement, and is not intended to confer upon any third party any rights or remedies hereunder. Customer acknowledges that it has not entered in this Agreement based on any representations other than those contained herein. The waiver of one breach or default or any delay in exercising any rights shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default.
