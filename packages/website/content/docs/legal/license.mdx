## 1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Company hereby grants you (a) a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the Software, (b) within the Tools, (c) during the term of the Subscription (d) that you purchased for your internal business use only (the “License”). This License is granted solely for the use set forth herein, and cannot be sublicensed, sold, or distributed to any third party except as expressly permitted by this Agreement or applicable law.

Licenses granted on a subscription basis expire at the end of the applicable subscription period set forth in the Order, unless renewed. Licenses granted for metered Offerings billed periodically based on usage continue as long as Customer continues to pay for its usage of the Offerings. All other licenses become perpetual upon payment in full.

We reserve the right to, at our sole discretion, modify, change, add, remove, or replace the Software and the Site, including the features and functionality, at any time with or without notice, provided that no such modification will materially diminish the features or functionality of the Software provided to you as of the effective date of Licensee’s then-current Order Form.

## 2. License Restrictions

Each License corresponds to a single user license (a “Permitted User”). Customer will ensure that each Permitted User only uses the Software through its assigned user account. If Customer exceeds the usage authorized by the Order Form (for example, by exceeding the number of Permitted Users), then we reserve the right to charge and invoice Customer the pro-rata fees corresponding to such overage.

Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, you may not:

1. Redistribute, sublicense, rent, lease, or lend the Software, in whole or in part, to any third party or use them to offer hosting services to a third party;
2. Copy, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code of the Software;
3. Use the Software in any manner that violates applicable laws, regulations, or third-party rights;
4. Install or use any third-party software or technology in any way that would subject our intellectual property or technology to any other license terms;
5. Separate and run or transfer parts of the Software in an attempt to circumvent this Agreement;
6. Upgrade or downgrade parts of the Software at different times;

## 3. Subscription and Fees

By subscribing, you agree to pay all applicable fees. Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless you cancel it in accordance with the cancellation policy.

Company reserves the right to suspend the services for the Software, without notice, for a reasonable period of time as may be necessary for (i) us to resolve any actual or threatened risks that, at our sole discretion, pose a credible risk of harm to the Software or the security or integrity; or (ii) if Customer’s account is thirty (30) days or more overdue (except with respect to charges then under reasonable and good faith dispute), without liability to Customer, until such amounts are paid in full.
